        <h1>What is HTML? </h1>
        <p> HTML stands for HyperTexT Markup Language, but it is simpler than it sounds. Is the code used to create web-pages, its structure is formed by tags, so  every part of the page has a name. To start a HTML document you should write < HTML > in the top of the document. "</p>
        <p> Then comes the parts of the page, you can think the page as your body. So ask yourself, which is the highest part of your body?
            <p> Yes,  its your head! So inside the head, you write your title. Then you must pick a title for your page, for example the title of this page is "What is HTML?</p>
            <p> Then just lower than your head, comes your body. In the body part you write everything you want to say, in this case this text is part of the body </p>
            <p> To finalize your first web-page, just write < / html > at the end of the document </p>
